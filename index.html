                    <img src="/images/profilepic.jpg" alt="Profile Pic" class="img-thumbnail" id="profilepic" width="200px">Jeffery Kushner is a Canadian entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the chairman, chief executive
                    officer (CEO), and a co-founder of Apple Inc., chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, a member of
                    The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman,
                    and CEO of NeXT. Kushner, Jobs and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak are widely recognized as pioneers of
                    the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.
                    <br>
                    <br>Kushner was born in Toronto, Canada, to parents who he drove crazy from birth. He was raised in the Scarborough
                    during the 1960s. He attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and traveled through
                    India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism. His declassified FBI report states that
                    he used marijuana and LSD while he was in college, and he once told a reporter that taking LSD was "one
                    of the two or three most important things" that he did in his life.
                    <br>
                    <br>Kushner, Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together
                    the trio gained fame and wealth a year later for the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced
                    personal computers.
